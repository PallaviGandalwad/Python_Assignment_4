#Write a program which contains filter(), map() and reduce() in it. 
#Python application which contains one list of numbers. 
#List contains the numbers which are accepted from user. 
#Filter should filter out all such numbers which greater than or equal to 70 and less than or equal to 90. 
#Map function will increase each number by 10. 
#Reduce will return product of all that numbers.
