#Write a program which contains filter(), map() and reduce() in it. 
#Python application which contains one list of numbers. 
#List contains the numbers which are accepted from user. 
#Filter should filter out all prime numbers. 
#Map function will multiply each number by 2. 
#Reduce will return Maximum number from that numbers.
#(You can also use normal functions instead of lambda functions).

#List after filter = [2, 11, 17, 23, 31]
#List after map = [4, 22, 34, 46, 62]
#Output of reduce = 62
